# 👋 Hey there!
I'm Akam TOUATI, an XR (Extended Reality) developer passionate about exploring the realms of VR, AR, computer vision, and robotics 🚀. With a keen eye for immersive experiences and a love for cutting-edge technology, I'm on a mission to push the boundaries of virtual and augmented realities.

🔭 Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of XR development, harnessing the power of Unity, Unreal Engine, and various AR frameworks to create captivating experiences. Whether it's building interactive simulations, crafting immersive storytelling, or enhancing real-world environments with digital overlays, I'm all about bringing imagination to life.

💻 Beyond XR, I'm fascinated by the intersection of computer vision and robotics. From object detection and tracking to autonomous navigation, I'm constantly exploring innovative ways to leverage vision-based systems for intelligent automation and enhanced human-machine interaction.

🌟 When I'm not coding, you'll find me tinkering with hardware, experimenting with new sensors, or simply lost in the latest research papers on spatial computing and machine perception. I thrive on collaboration and am always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and pioneers in the XR, AR, CV, and robotics communities.
